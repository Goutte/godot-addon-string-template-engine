# Legacy files

We don't use these (anymore), so they are not included in the distributed addon.
Yet I don't want to delete them just yet.

## Loader & Saver

If those are present (uncomment the `extends` directive),
the Filesystem dock does not open the .tpl files in the Code Editor,
but only in the Inspector, which is not the behavior we want.
